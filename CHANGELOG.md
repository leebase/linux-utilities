# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-10

Initial public release candidate of `sysdiff`.

- Compares two explicit `key=value` snapshot files without inspecting the live
  system.
- Emits deterministic sorted added (`+`), removed (`-`), and changed (`~`)
  records; reports `no changes` for identical snapshots.
- Validates keys, duplicate records, embedded NUL bytes, line and entry limits,
  and avoids partial stdout on comparison errors.
- Accepts LF, CRLF, final lines without a newline, comments, and blank or
  whitespace-only space/tab lines.
- Provides strict compiler, formatting, static-analysis, sanitizer, Valgrind,
  fixture, pytest, smoke, and Ubuntu CI coverage.

Known limitations: values are opaque text and changed records use a human
readable `old -> new` presentation, so that line format is not reversible when
values themselves contain ` -> `. `sysdiff` does not collect live snapshots.
